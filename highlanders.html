                1. "We, who live in the hills, have no permanent place, no proper land lease facility, and no housing
                facility."
                2. "We have been living in the mountains for generations. The only occupations we know are honey
                extraction and agriculture. It is unfair to ask us to leave this mountain and change our place."
                3. "Animals often visit us like family guests, and we have a good relationship with them. But when
                someone hunts, they arrest us for hunting."
                4. "When we cut sandalwood, we are arrested, imprisoned, and tortured. But the forest officials know
                very well who is doing all this. The man with money preys on us, who have no money."
                5. "We don't have road facilities, housing facilities, medical facilities, school facilities,
                electricity facilities, or water facilities. Even if the government orders to provide these, politicians
                and government officials do not fulfill our needs. Although many regimes have changed, there has been no
                progress in our lives."
                6. "Without proper roads and medical facilities, snakebites and childbirth often lead to death. Many
                lives are lost due to the negligence of this government and officials with their money. We become the
                scapegoat for their needs."
                7. "This society has shown us its name, but in reality, whoever claims to have shown us is the same."
                8. "This forest is our protection, and we are the protectors of this forest. This forest is our temple;
                both the trees and the animals that live in it are our gods."
