           1.Farmers protesting at Delhiâ€™s Jantar Mantar say Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pre-2019 election pledges,
            like doubling farmers' income by 2022 and implementing MSP as per production costs, remain unfulfilled.
            2.They symbolically sit with alleged human remains, claiming one lakh farmer suicides under the Modi regime.
            3.Accusing both state and central governments of neglect, they threaten to protest in Varanasi. 
            4."Please,please save farmers," pleads a protester, alleging police assault and media censorship.
            5.The issue of farmer suicides in India is multifaceted, driven by financial burdens, crop failure, social
            pressures, regional disparities, environmental challenges, mental health issues, and lack of support
            systems. Solving it demands a holistic approach integrating financial aid, mental health services,
            agricultural reforms, and tailored social welfare initiatives.
