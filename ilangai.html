                1.Velupillai Prabhakaran led the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during the Sri Lankan Civil War.
                2.His aim was to establish an independent state for Tamil people in northern Sri Lanka.
                3.Under his leadership, the LTTE became known as one of the most lethal guerrilla groups globally.
                4.Prabhakaran was born in Valvettiturai in 1954 and faced discrimination against Tamils in post-independence Sri Lanka.
                5.He formed the Tamil New Tigers (TNT) in 1972, which later evolved into the LTTE.
                6.Prabhakaran initiated suicide bombings and enforced strict rules within the LTTE.

                10.Despite attempts at ceasefire facilitated by Norway in 2001, conflict resumed, leading to the eventual defeat of the LTTE.
