                    1.Homelessness: People sleeping on the streets are often experiencing homelessness, which can
                    result from various factors such as poverty, unemployment, mental illness, addiction, or fleeing
                    from abusive situations.

                    2.Lack of Shelter: Many street sleepers lack access to stable housing or shelters due to
                    overcrowding, lack of resources, or personal reasons.

                    3.Vulnerability: Sleeping rough exposes individuals to numerous risks including violence,
                    theft, exposure to harsh weather conditions, and health issues.

                    4.Community Support: Non-profit organizations, shelters, and government programs often provide
                    support services such as temporary housing, meals, healthcare, and social assistance to help address
                    the needs of people experiencing homelessness.

                    5.Complex Issue: Homelessness is a multifaceted issue that requires systemic solutions
                    including affordable housing, mental health support, substance abuse treatment, and employment
                    opportunities to effectively address the root causes and provide sustainable solutions for those
                    affected.</label>
